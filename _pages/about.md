Hello! I'm Ioanna!

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/).
Previously, I was a Visiting Research Scholar in [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/),
where I worked with [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/) and [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/).

I hold a Masterâ€™s in Biomedical Engineering from the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/), and
a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/).

My research interests include deep learning for health and biology, multimodal learning, and explainable AI.
I also like to explore the intersection of machine learning and systems.

Beyond research, I enjoy sports, learning new languages, cooking, and reading books.
