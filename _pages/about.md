Hello! I'm Ioanna!

I'm a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). I hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/), where I completed my thesis under the guidance of Professors [Konstantinos Moustakas](https://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/) and [Athanasios Lourbopoulos](https://www.pharmacology-research.gr/portal/en/home-neuro).

Currently, I am a Visiting Research Scholar at [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/).
I am a member of the [ATLAS Group](https://atlas.cs.brown.edu/) advised by [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/), working on the application of machine learning to systems.
I am also part of the [Singh Lab](https://rsinghlab.org/), advised by [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/), where I focus on Health NLP.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, biology, and systems and my ambition is to find new ways to solve complicated problems in these areas.
