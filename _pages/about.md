Hello!

My name is Ioanna, and I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). I also work as an electronics and software engineer at [Radiometer Medical](https://www.radiometer.com/).

I have previously studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/), where I completed my thesis under the guidance of Professors [Konstantinos Moustakas](https://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/) and [Athanasios Lourbopoulos](https://www.pharmacology-research.gr/portal/en/home-neuro). 

I am highy interested in neuroengineering and learning how the brain works. I am particularly fascinated by the integration of machine and deep learning in medicine and biology, which I actively explore in my studies. My ambition is to find new ways to solve complicated problems in these areas.
