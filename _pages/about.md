Hello! I'm Ioanna!

I'm an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/).
Previously, I was a Visiting Research Scholar in [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/),
where I worked in the [Singh Lab](https://rsinghlab.org/) with [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/) on Health NLP
and in the [ATLAS Group](https://atlas.cs.brown.edu/) with [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/)
on the application of machine learning to systems.

Currently, I am finishing my Masterâ€™s in Biomedical Engineering at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/).
I hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/),
where I was advised by Profs. [Konstantinos Moustakas](https://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/) and [Athanasios Lourbopoulos](https://www.pharmacology-research.gr/portal/en/home-neuro).

My research interests include deep learning for health and biology, multimodal learning, and explainable AI.
I also like to explore the intersection of machine learning and systems.

Beyond research, I enjoy sports, learning new languages, cooking, and reading books.
